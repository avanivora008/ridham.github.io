                <li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
                <li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
                <li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple
 text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
